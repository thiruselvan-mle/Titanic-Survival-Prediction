<img src="app/titanic.png" alt="APP DEMO" width="100%" height="500">

##  Project Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster based on personal and travel details such as class, age, gender, fare, and more.  
It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on the Titanic dataset.

This repository is designed for **beginners starting their Machine Learning journey**, showing how to approach a Kaggle competition step by step in a simple and clear way.  

The app is built with:
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Streamlit** (for the interactive web app)
